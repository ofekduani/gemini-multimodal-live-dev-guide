Project Pastra (Chapter 8) - User Overview
===========================================

What is Project Pastra?
-----------------------
Project Pastra is a mobile-first, multimodal AI assistant web application inspired by Google DeepMind's Project Astra. It allows users to interact with an AI assistant using voice, video, and text, and provides real-time responses, weather, and stock information. The app is designed for both mobile and desktop browsers.

Where is it hosted?
-------------------
The live application is hosted on Google Cloud Run at:
https://project-pastra-dev-api-147586231663.us-central1.run.app

What is needed to make a change?
--------------------------------
- You need access to the source code, located in the Chapter 8 directory:
  /Users/ofekduani/Desktop/project pastra/gemini-multimodal-live-dev-guide/part_2_dev_api/chapter_08/
- You need Docker and Google Cloud SDK installed and configured.
- You need valid API keys for Gemini, OpenWeather, and Finnhub.
- After making code changes, you must rebuild the Docker image, push it to Google Container Registry, and redeploy to Cloud Run.

When is it necessary to redeploy?
---------------------------------
- Any time you change the source code (HTML, JS, CSS, etc.).
- When you update or rotate API keys.
- When you change environment variables or configuration.
